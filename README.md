# sama_app

### Installation
1) npm install
2) npm run install-all
3) npm run app

Since I was just using Express and Mongo/Mongoose for the backend, and not a 'true' MVC framework (the client-side React code would be the 'view' I suppose), I decided to simply separate that app into two main folders: client and server.

### Trade-Offs

Seeing this was a quick proof-of-concept style of app, I decided to focus on the basic CRUD functionality of the forms and boxes first. Future work would be needed on the positioning of boxes, as well as a much deeper dive into design and UI/UX.

### Most Proud

I felt most proud of setting up the API and utilization of React Router features to cut down on 'prop-drilling'.
